This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Project
This is very basic demonstration of my capstone idea. The code includes a few components and pages demonstrating what kind of content I want to include and an evaluation of possible code editor packages. 

## Running the project
Run using 
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
